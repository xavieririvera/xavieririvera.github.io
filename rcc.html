    <h1 class="heading-39">Romanian Crown Council, 1937</h1>
    <p class="paragraph-3">In the interwar period, Romania faced a number of threats from both within and without. New territory, acquired in the Paris Peace accords, proved difficult to integrate into the greater Kingdom of Romania both socially and economically, and the country as a whole faced an economic crisis as industry remained stagnant in a primarily agrarian society. Further exacerbating this issue was the rise of fascist groups and tensions between ethnic Romanians and newly integrated outsiders, which led to violence--especially in border areas. In this time of turmoil, King Carol II was responsible for the decision-making for the nation as a whole following his imposition of martial law and coup of the existing government. He is empowered to convene his Crown Council to “make decisions in moments of severe crisis,” which in this interwar period included a number of issues, culminating historically with Romania’s decision to align with Germany. This committee reconvenes that council with the hope that it can lead the Kingdom of Romania into a new era of capable management, maintain the authority of the Monarchy, and improve the lives of Romanian citizens.</p>

          <div class = "text">
          <p>
            Elodie Currier is member of the Walsh School of Foreign Service’s class of 2019, majoring in International Politics with a concentration in International Law, Institutions and Ethics. Because that isn’t enough of a mouthful, she is also pursuing a certificate in Jewish Civilization. A die-hard New Englander, Elodie was raised in West Hartford, Connecticut, where she was first introduced to Model UN as a high school freshman. Since then, she’s been fully immersed in the Model UN world, and currently helps to lead Georgetown’s travel team, as well as staffing NAIMUN, our high school conference, where she served as Director of Registration. This is her third NCSC (and the second to fall on her birthday weekend), having been a crisis analyst at NCSC XLIII and a chair for CNSA at NCSC XLIV.  Outside of MUN, Elodie can be found battling her Snapchat addiction, attempting to cook half-decent Chinese food, or roaming DC with friends. She cannot wait to serve as your chair, and looks forward to meeting all of you in October!

          <h4><b>Patricia Lin</b></h4>
          <p>Patricia Lin is a junior in the School of Foreign Service, studying International Economics. She's originally from Northern California–and will defend Tupac over Biggie any day of the week, can’t live without avocados, and wasn’t familiar with the concept of rain or snow until coming to DC. When not learning about cost curves and exchange rates, you can probably find her engaged in some sort of fine art, whether it be drawing, painting, or printmaking, or listening to music. Besides staffing NCSC, Patricia is involved in a plethora of wonderful organizations and clubs on campus. She is the Director of Communications for the Georgetown International Relations Club, and travels with Georgetown's Model UN team. She's also a member of Carroll Fellows, an academic program on campus, works for the university as a graphic designer, and is a barista at Philz Coffee.</p>
