  <h1 class="heading-75">The Battle for Detroit JCC, 1930</h1>
  <h3 class="heading-95">The Purple Gang v. the Detroit Partnership</h3>
  <p class="paragraph-34">The year is 1930. Over the last decade, the predominantly-Jewish Purple Gang has gained relative dominance over the Detroit underworld through incredible and ruthless violence, effective business practices, and control of the Great Lakes bootlegging trade. However, the Gang has begun to go soft through years of continued preeminence. They frequent nightclubs, dress flamboyantly, flaunt their wealth, and openly defy the law. Meanwhile a collection of Sicilian and Italian street gangs, after over a decade of infighting, have grown tired of living under the thumb of a Jewish minority and have come together with the aid of the newly formed Commission of the Five Families of New York to oppose the Purple Gang and vie for control of the Detroit underworld. Can the Purple Gang rewrite history, reverse their decline, and maintain their hold on power? Can the Detroit Partnership throw off the Purples and claim Detroit for their own? It’s up to delegates to decide.</p>

            <p>
              Arianna Skipper is a senior in Georgetown University’s School of Foreign Service, majoring in International Politics and Law, and is excited to be your chair for the Purple Gang committee. She began her Model UN career when she came to Georgetown sophomore year, and it has been one of her favorite college experiences by far. Many of her closest friends and favorite memories were made during NCSC, NAIMUN, and while traveling on the team. Outside of Model UN, she is on the committee of Special Events for the Georgetown International Relations Club and works for the Embassy of Israel in DC. With whatever spare time is left outside of work and class, you can typically find her jogging or cycling during rush hour and getting hit by cars. She wishes you good luck, and looks forward to seeing all of you in October!
