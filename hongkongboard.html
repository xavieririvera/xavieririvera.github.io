  <h1 class="heading-56">Hong Kong Board of City Directors, 2014</h1>
  <div class="section-subtitle">Hong Kong: a global city, a financial powerhouse, and home to brewing political tension. Since its handover from the British to China in 1997, Hong Kong has faced a world of uncertainty manifesting itself in a series of social movements. Currently operating under policy crafted by Deng Xiaoping and Margaret Thatcher, it is a city existing as “One Country, Two Systems,” indicative of its unique place as both systematically independent from while also fundamentally linked to the Chinese political, economic and social systems. This committee will examine present-day Hong Kong as its citizens grapple with an uncertain future, with the 2047 date of official reclamation by China impending. Echoes of Hong Kong’s colonial past will infiltrate discussions of national identity, economic power, and social stability, as members of Hong Kong’s Executive Council work to make decisions that can appease both Hong Kong independence activists and the Chinese Communist Party. The committee will begin in 2014, following protests regarding Chinese-led reforms to nationalize Hong Kong’s education system in accordance with Chinese values and Mandarin language, putting both Hong Kong’s freedom of speech and Cantonese language culture in jeopardy. The committee will subsequently explore the flaws in Hong Kong’s current political system and elections, a series of mysterious disappearances of anti-China journalists and activists, and recent protests such as the Umbrella Revolution--and then the committee will look at long-term solutions.</div>

          <div class = "text">
          <p>
            Brent Peabody hails from humid Atlanta, Georgia and is now a senior (yikes!) studying Science, Technology, and International Affairs with a focus on security in the School of Foreign Service. He is also pursuing a minor in classical studies, something that began as a happy mistake sophomore year when he accidentally entered the wrong classroom and was too polite to leave. Brent is active in Georgetown’s Model UN community, having twice served on the secretariat of NCSC’s high school counterpart and sister conference NAIMUN as an undersecretary general and also as a member of Georgetown’s own Model UN team. He has very much enjoyed staffing NCSC in addition to this, having previously served as a crisis analyst his sophomore year and a CHAIR his junior year. Outside of Model UN, Brent has enjoyed being involved in the co-ed service fraternity APO, serving as a peer advisor to incoming freshman in the School of Foreign Service, and being a member of an underperforming but very promising intramural soccer team. When not kept busy by the above, Brent enjoys traveling, watching TV, and chilling with friends over sweet tea, which he brews in his own dorm.

          <h4><b>Halle Hagan</b></h4>
          <p>Halle Hagan is a member of the Georgetown Walsh School of Foreign Service’s class of 2018, pursuing a major in Science, Technology &amp; International Affairs with concentrations in Business, Growth and Development and Computer Science, as well as a minor in Chinese. Growing up in Hong Kong inspired her interest in international affairs, particularly those concerning Asia. Hence, she was extremely excited to craft a Hong Kong Committee for NCSC XLV. This will be Halle's final NCSC, and her eighth and final year doing Model UN. Halle has been involved in Model UN at Georgetown through both NCSC and NAIMUN, NCSC's Sister Conference, where she recently completed her tenure as the Executive Director of NAIMUN LIV. Outside of Model UN, Halle works as an RA in a freshman residence hall, reads and writes poetry, and seeks out new restaurants to try in her spare time to maintain her status as a #foodie. Halle looks forward to working with the rest of the NCSC Staff to create a great conference this year! </p>
